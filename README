We have submitted 2 predictors-
1) Bimode Predictor- code: bimode.h, results: result_bimode 
2) Tournament Bias Predictor- code: tournament_bias.h, results: result_tourbias

Details can be found in the report.

We edited the branch_record_c class slightly to add one variable to account to predicted result (to be later compared with actual result).
Although this can be avoided by some workaround in the predictor.h code itself, but the former just seemed easier.
